## Understanding Kubernetes Pods

### **Description:**
This diagram illustrates the fundamental concept of a Pod in Kubernetes. A Pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, representing an abstraction over containers. It typically contains one or more containers that are deployed together on the same host. Pods are essential in Kubernetes as they encapsulate the application containers, storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run.

- **Node:** The physical or virtual machine on which Kubernetes runs and manages the Pods.
- **Pod:** The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, which can encapsulate one or more containers. It is designed to host the application's processes.
- **Container:** The actual instance of a containerized application running inside the Pod.
- **Abstraction over Container:** Pods act as an abstraction layer over the underlying containers, making it easier to manage and orchestrate containerized applications within Kubernetes.

This concept is crucial for understanding how Kubernetes organizes and manages containerized workloads across multiple nodes in a cluster.

## Overview of the concept of Pods in Kubernetes:

1. **Smallest Unit in Kubernetes**: A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in the Kubernetes ecosystem. It is the atomic unit of scheduling in Kubernetes.

2. **Abstraction Over Container**: Pods are an abstraction that can contain one or more containers, often Docker containers. They provide a higher-level grouping of containers that share the same network and storage resources.

3. **Usually 1 Application per Pod**: Typically, each Pod runs a single application (or a closely related set of applications) and encapsulates an applicationâ€™s container, storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run.

4. **Each Pod Gets Its Own IP Address**: Each Pod has its own IP address, which means that containers within the same Pod can communicate with each other using `localhost`, while different Pods communicate with each other using their respective IP addresses.

5. **Pods Are Ephemeral**: Pods are designed to be ephemeral; they can be created, destroyed, and recreated by the Kubernetes control plane. This means that the IP address of a Pod may change over time, 
and  because of that we use Services to persist this Ip addresses, persistent data should not be stored within a Pod itself.
