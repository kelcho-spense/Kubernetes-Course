- The content highlights the shift from **monolithic** architecture to **microservices**.
- In monolithic architecture, the application is a single, unified entity.
- With microservices, the application is broken down into smaller, independent services, each represented as separate "App" icons.
- This transition creates the need for a container orchestration tool to efficiently manage these distributed services.
- The containers encapsulate the microservices, which simplifies their deployment and management across different environments, reinforcing the need for a container orchestration tool.

## What Features do orchestration tools offer ?
1. High availability
