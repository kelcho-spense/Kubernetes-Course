# Main Kubernetes Components

### **Description:**
This visual highlights the essential components of Kubernetes, which are integral to understanding how Kubernetes functions. Each component plays a critical role in managing and orchestrating containerized applications within a Kubernetes cluster.

### **Components:**

- **Pod:** The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A pod represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.
- **Service:** An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.
- **Ingress:** Manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP.
- **ConfigMap:** A way to inject configuration data into Pods, allowing decoupling of environment-specific configurations from container images.
- **Secret:** Used to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys.
- **StatefulSet:** A workload API object used to manage stateful applications.
- **DaemonSet:** Ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a Pod.
- **Deployment:** A higher-level concept that manages replica sets and provides declarative updates to applications.

These components together form the building blocks for deploying, managing, and scaling applications within Kubernetes, enabling a robust and flexible infrastructure.
